        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>This ceviche recipe is a staple in Mexico and features raw seafood cured with lime juice. Now don't wrinkle your nose! You would never know the seafood was not cooked before serving. 
                Make sure to always use the freshest ingredients. Serve in fancy glasses with a lime slice hanging over the rim.</p>
